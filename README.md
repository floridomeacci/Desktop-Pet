  <h3 align="center">TBWA Desktop Pet</h3>

  <p align="center">
    At TBWA I've been working on my own personal productivity tool that sits on top of my screen and provides useful tips and insights. Grossly inspired by the famous Clippy, bordering on the edge of copyright infringement.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is almost entirely coded by ChatGPT with me at the steering wheel, where as the 3D artwork is done by me. I wanted to see if I could create something trivial such as a desktop pet using ChatGPT. The pet is draggable and sits infront of other windows. Every now and then the pet gives a tip in the style of Clippy.

The uploaded code to github is 90% completed. TBWA has strict security protocals, this meant rewriting the code to work with their wordpress environment. I'm still working on some final issues and features but my time is limited as since I'm doing this in my spare time.

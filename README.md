    At TBWA, I've been working on a personal productivity tool that sits atop my screen, providing useful tips and insights. Inspired by the famous Clippy, it teeters on the edge of copyright infringement.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was almost entirely coded by ChatGPT, with me at the helm, while the 3D artwork was created by me. I aimed to see if it was feasible to create something as whimsical as a desktop pet using ChatGPT. The pet is draggable and remains in front of other windows. Periodically, the pet offers a tip, reminiscent of Clippy's style.
